# Proverbs Collections

The Book of Proverbs in the Bible is a collection of inspired wise sayings.
Many people find it helpful to gather the set of Proverbs on various topics in
order to see the sum total of what Proverbs says explicitly on any given
subject. Someone might find it helpful to read all Proverbs concerning
politics, or money, or speech, etc. This website is designed to allow the
dynamic creation and display of such collections.
